CAPSTONE 1 PROJECT PROPOSAL - COSTUME INVENTORY DB MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Diana Jewell 
Springboard Software Engineering Track - October 2021

What goal will your website be designed to achieve? 

- Cleaner + more user friendly inventory management system 
- Ability to add new costumes, update existing costumes, delete costumes no longer in use
- Additionally having a client-only access where they can simply view the costume for their childâ€™s class


What kind of users will visit your site? In other words, what is the demographic of your users? 

- Mostly it will be the administrators of the dance studio
- Secondarily access for the clients of the studio as described above


What data do you plan on using? You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it to contain. 

- All data relating to the costumes currently in stock
-- Production the costume appears in (may be more than one)
-- Ballet level the costume is for (may be more than one)
-- Headpieces / Accessories / props associated with the costume (may be utilized by more than one costume style)
-- Image of the costume
-- Size Chart



In brief, outline your approach to creating your project (knowing that you may not know everything in advance and that these details might change later). Answer questions like the ones below, but feel free to add more information: 

What does your database schema look like? 
- See separate image

What kinds of issues might you run into with your API? 
- No external API, but do I need to create my own API to pass through so as to keep the data more separate from the browser/user experience?

Is there any sensitive information you need to secure? 
- User authorizations, user login information? 

What functionality will your app include? 
- Create New Costume 
- Update existing costumes
- Delete existing costumes
- View existing costumes
- Visualize several costumes as they would be on stage together? To see how they look together? 
- It may be beneficial to be able to see how many costumes are in use at a single performance, which costumes get used the most frequently, etc


What will the user flow look like?
- Admin user - 
-- Log in
-- See search menu -> ability to search by 
--- Ballet level
--- Ballet production
--- Color? 
-- Navigate to specific costume groups
-- See details about that costume group including
--- Maker
--- Quantity
--- Size Chart
--- Currently in use
--- Storage Location

QUESTIONS:
- Could this be made more generically? Like, more easily able to be applied to other dance studios/companies?
- Is there a way I could build additional functionality to be able to assign a costume size to a dancer based on the costume size chart and the dancer measurements? I currently do this by hand, but could I somehow import into my app the dancer's measurements and have it return to me the closest size that they could try on?
